# Mode: ASK – Analysis

> Purpose: Fast, well-founded answers — **without** changes to the code.

## Procedure
1) **KEYSET** (only real repo elements):
KEYSET:

affected modules: [...]

calc keys: [...]

session keys: [...]

crm tables/columns: [...]

pdf placeholders/coords: [...]

markdown
Copy code
2) **Brief Analysis**: Problem/question, assumptions, risks.
3) **Result**: precise answer, steps, possibly a code sketch **without** file modification.

## Limitations
- No persistence/commits/edits.
- No fantasy keys. German, precise.
